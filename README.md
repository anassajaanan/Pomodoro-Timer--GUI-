- Plays a sound when the timer reaches zero.
- Provides start and reset buttons to control the timer.

## Requirements

## Running the timer

To run the Pomodoro timer, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt window.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
